        <p>
            As a DevOps Engineer looking for a job, I was thinking of ways to step up my game,<br>
            showing the entire range of my skills, knowledge and abilities, rather than<br>
            compromising on a one-pager CV, just to meet the job requirements -<br>
            I decided to build a website that will presentâ€¦ me.

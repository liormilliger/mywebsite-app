        <p>
            My journey into DevOps started with a simple realization: computers never forget what you tell them to do,<br>
            they just do it exactly as you said (which, as it turns out, isn’t always what you meant).<br>
            That curiosity for how systems behave, and occasionally misbehave, led me to what I do today:<br>
            building scalable, reliable, and secure infrastructure that behaves exactly as intended.<br>
            <br><br>
            Over the years, I’ve worked across cloud platforms, CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes clusters, and monitoring stacks,<br>
            designing systems that make both developers and operations teams sleep better at night (most nights, anyway).<br>
            I believe great DevOps isn’t just about automation, it’s about understanding how people and systems interact,<br>
            and removing friction between the two.

            This website is more than a digital résumé.<br>
            It’s a living example of how I approach infrastructure - modular, observable, and a little bit fun.<br>
            If you visit the Tech Stack page, you’ll find a breakdown of the tools and platforms running behind the scenes here.<br>
            <br><br>
            When I’m not tuning deployments or chasing down elusive latency spikes, you’ll usually find me<br>
            experimenting with new technologies or automating something that probably didn’t need automating<br>
            (but now runs perfectly every time). -->
